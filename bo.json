The Democrats' failure to create jobs was at the heart of the shellacking. Nothing says ''outsourcing'' to the American public more succinctly than India. But the White House didn't figure this out until the eve of Obama's Friday departure, when it hastily rebranded his trip as a jobs mission. Perhaps the president should visit one of the Indian call centers policing Americans' credit-card debts to feel our pain. Optics matter. If Washington is tumbling into a political crisis as the recovery continues to lag, maybe the president shouldn't get out of Dodge. If the White House couldn't fill a 13,000-seat arena in blue Cleveland the weekend before the midterms, maybe it shouldn't have sent the president there. If an administration charged with confronting a Great Recession knew that its nominee for secretary of the Treasury serially cut corners on his taxes, maybe it should have considered other options. Shoulda, woulda, coulda.

Bush of Texas spent $13.1 million in February, more than half of it on television and radio advertisements in the crucial primary contests that helped him become the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, the Bush campaign said yesterday. By the end of February, Mr. Bush had spent a record $63.2 million, more than double the amount spent by his main rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona. The Bush campaign has raised a record $73.8 million from nearly 196,000 individuals. Although Mr. Bush himself did not attend any fund-raisers in February, the campaign raised $3.2 million and had $10.6 million in the bank on Feb. 29, the campaign said.
